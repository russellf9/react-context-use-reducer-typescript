# Testing Reducer pattern with Hooks and Typescript

## Motivation

Previously I was using Redux for state management, with updates to React I thought it would be interesting to try using built in React Hooks.

I followed the tutorial from [React Context with useReducer and Typescript.](https://dev.to/elisealcala/react-context-with-usereducer-and-typescript-4obm).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
